AddressBook Level 3.14 (Abπ) is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Abπ can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g hans will match Hans
* At least 1 parameter must be present.
* Name, phone number, email, address, memo and tags are eligible parameters.
* Specifying the parameter followed by the word to search for helps to scope the search to that specific attribute.
* Name, phone number and email follows a partial word match criteria where "Han" will match with "Hans" and "904" would match with "90400203".
* Tag, address and email follows an exact word match criteria where "Hans" will match with "Hans" or "hans".
* For both search criteria, order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. Hans Bo will match Bo Hans
* For both search criteria, as long as there is a word match (partial/exact), the contact would be in the filtered list.
